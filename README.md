I explored a classically forbidden particle process by performing theoretical calculations on Mathematica using the FeynCalc package (about 1200 lines of code). This work was performed in collaboration with Prof. Alexey Petrov of Wayne State University and Prof. Daniel Grin from Haverford College. This project was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant number: NSF-PHY-1460853).
